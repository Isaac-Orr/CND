# Cloud Native Development (CND)
A repo for Notebooks, code and tutorials for the Cloud Native Development module.

## Pre-work 
For best results:
- 0_1 (Linux) should be run in Google Colab (link in the top right corner of the Notebook)
- 0_2 (APIs) should be accessed in the GitHub web UI
- 0_3 (Building an API) should be run on a local version of Python (i.e. on your PC or laptop). You may well be prevented from running a command prompt/terminal/shell on a company machine. Do not worry if so, just readthrough the Notebook here on Github rather than recreating
- 0_4 (Accessing an API) should be run in Google Colab
